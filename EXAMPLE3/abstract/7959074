 Techniques are described for use in selectively authorizing proposed      transactions under certain circumstances, such as when payments for the      transactions are not assured. In some situations, when payments to a      merchant from customers are not assured for proposed item acquisition      transactions involving those customers, determinations are made to      authorize and proceed with at least some of those proposed transactions      in an automatic and selective manner without the assurance of receiving      the payments for the selected transactions. For example, a selective      determination of whether to authorize a proposed transaction may be made      based on analyzing information about the proposed transaction (e.g.,      about the item(s) involved in the transaction, a  payment  amount of the      transaction, the customer(s) involved in the transactions, etc.) and on      information regarding other prior transactions. If a proposed transaction      is authorized, the merchant may then proceed to initiate fulfillment of      the transaction before the merchant receives  payment .
