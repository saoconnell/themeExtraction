 An integrated electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) system is      disclosed which obtains bills for customers (which include individuals,      businesses, and organizations) and allow payments including payments by      credit card to be processed at the biller websites on behalf of      customers. The integrated EBPP system obtains bills for customers from      paper billers, electronic billers, and scrape-enabled biller websites,      with customers providing access information for biller websites to the      integrated EBPP system, which uses a software agent or bot to make      scheduled scrapes of biller websites to obtain customer bills. The      integrated EBPP system enables customers to automatically set up a user      account at biller websites, with customers providing user access      information and user  financial  account information, such as a credit card      or debit card, for accessing biller websites and for initiating payments      at biller websites.
