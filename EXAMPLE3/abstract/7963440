The vendor-terminal      sends a shipping order, to a delivery company-terminal of a deliverer.      The user-terminal confirms the acceptance of the ordered goods by      creating an approval for  payment  destined to the vendor terminal and      forwards the approval towards the vendor terminal.

The vendor      terminal, upon reception of the proof of transferring the money, notifies      the delivery company terminal of acceptance of the goods and the      successful  payment .
