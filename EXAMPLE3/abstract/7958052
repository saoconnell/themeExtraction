 A cardholder-initiated  financial  transaction using a cardholder      controlled input device in communication with a payment card network and      a database is disclosed. The cardholder uses a payment card issued to the      cardholder by an issuer bank. An exemplary method includes the steps of      storing merchant data within the database including data identifying the      merchants registered to utilize the card network and receiving from the      input device transaction data relating to the  financial  transaction. The      transaction data includes an authorization request and merchant      identifying data that identifies the merchant involved in the      transaction. The method further includes determining that the identified      merchant is registered to utilize the card network by comparing the      transaction data with the merchant data stored in the database,      forwarding the authorization request to the issuer bank, receiving a      response to the request from the issuer bank, and automatically      forwarding the response to the input device.
