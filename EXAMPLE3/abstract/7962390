 A data mining device, method, and apparatus configured to associate      customer exclusive data from a payment card or device after a  financial       transaction. A  financial  transaction processing system comprises a report      distribution management system, a data relationship manager, and a      customer exclusive data association database. The report distribution      management system receives  financial  transaction data. The data      relationship manager determines an issuer associated with the  financial       transaction data, queries a subscription database for subscription data      associated with the issuer and a core database for the issuer processing      parameters. The processing parameters are applied to the  financial       transaction data and the subscription data. A customer exclusive data      association database is updated with the  financial  transaction data once      the processing parameters are applied.
