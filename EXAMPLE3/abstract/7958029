 A method and system for managing  financial  risk through the use of      postpaid processing during use of wireless services is presented within      the scope of the following invention. The present invention uses credit      card authorization to pre-reserve credit card funds for wireless services      in excess of planned usage. Authorizations eliminate the credit risk      associated with overages and payment timing, and also maintain a customer      experience identical to postpaid processing. The authorizations are      invisible to the customer and no charge is brought to a customer's credit      card until the monthly bill is settled. Separating the authorization and      settlement stages of retail wireless payment processing allows the      branded wireless provider to avoid inherent areas of credit risk during      the tenure of a customer's wireless  service,  while maintaining a familiar      customer experience.
