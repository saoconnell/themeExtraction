<BR><BR> Commonly, a seller of goods uses a financial application to manage an inventory of products sold by the seller.  Specifically, the entity uses the financial application to track information related to the products (e.g., product descriptions,
price of products, related products, etc.).  In many cases, an e-commerce web site may be used by the seller of goods to sell the products.  The e-commerce web site may also include a variety of information related to the products.
<BR><BR> The seller may wish to include product information for a product from the financial application in the e-commerce web site related to the product.  Specifically, the seller may extract the product information from the financial application and
then use the product information to build or modify the e-commerce web site.  In some cases, the product information may be modified before building or modifying the e-commerce web site.  Further, the seller may wish to also include any such
modifications in the financial application.
<BR><BR> Sales of an e-commerce site are generally driven by the web traffic of the e-commerce site.  Much of an e-commerce site's web traffic originates from various search engines found on the world wide web (www).  In view of this, it may be desirable
to optimize the product information to increase the e-commerce site's search ranking for the search engines.  Typically, the product information is manually analyzed for potential optimizations such as keywords (e.g., uniform resource locator, content,
header, domain name, etc.), ingoing links, outgoing links, frequency of updates, etc.

page(s) (104) to the search optimization system (110).  For example, a web site (102) may be configured to provide a web page search profile to the search optimization system (110).  In this example, the web page search profile may include a variety of
information related to searching (e.g., keywords, meta-tags, Uniform Resource Locator (URL), title, etc.) for the web pages (104) of the web site (102).
<BR><BR> In one or more embodiments of the invention, the search optimization system (110) may be configured to obtain and store information in the search optimization data repository (120).  The search optimization data repository (120) may be a data
store (e.g., a database, a file system, one or more data structures configured in a memory, an extensible markup language (XML) file, some other medium for storing data, or any suitable combination thereof), which may include data (e.g., product data,
search engine data, user data, search optimization history, etc.) related to search optimizations.
<BR><BR> In one or more embodiments of the invention, the search optimization system (110) may be configured to process product data using a search optimization module (118).  More specifically, the search optimization module (118) may be configured to
process product data to obtain optimization data.  For example, the search optimization module (118) may be configured to analyze product data based on search engine data to obtain optimization data.  In this example, the optimization data includes
recommendations for updating a web page (104) to increase web traffic from the corresponding search engine(s).  Those skilled in the art will appreciate that optimization data for the web page (104) may include a variety of recommendations (e.g.,
alternate keywords for use in a product description, recommended ingoing links, recommended outgoing links, etc.).  In this case, an ingoing link may be any link from an external web site directing a visitor to a web site (108) including the web page
(104).  Further, an outgoing link may be any link on the web page (104) directing a visitor to an external web site from the web site (108) including the web page (104).
<BR><BR> In one or more embodiments of the invention, the search optimization module (118) may process product data based on search engine data in the search optimization data repository (120).  For example, a particular search engine may heavily favor
keywords used in uniform resource locators.  In this example, the search optimization module (118) would favor recommending keywords in uniform resource locators when processing product data for the particular search engine.  Those skilled in the art
will appreciate that product data may be processed based on search engine data for any number of search engines.  Further, the search engine data in the search optimization data repository (120) may be based on previous search optimizations. 
Specifically, search engine data may be obtained based on a previous search optimization as well as the results (i.e., resulting search ranking of updated web page (104)) of implementing the previous search optimization.  Those skilled in the art will
appreciate that the search engine data in the search optimization data repository (120) may also be based on commonly available data for the search engines.
<BR><BR> In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user(s) (106) may interact with the search optimization system (110).  For example, the user(s) (106) may access the search optimization system (110) over the Internet (or other Wide Area Network
or Local Area Network) through a web browser (or via another interface for communicating over a network).  Alternatively, the user(s) (106) may interact with the search optimization system (110) through an application running natively on the user's (106)
local computer (not shown).  Further, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the search optimization system (110) may interact with the user(s) (106) through use of notifications.  The notifications may be conveyed by electronic mail, short message
<B><I>service</I></B> (SMS), or some other form of electronic correspondence.
<BR><BR> In one or more embodiments of the invention, the search optimization system (110) is configured to receive requests for search optimizations from the user(s) (106).  A request for a search optimization may include a variety of product data
(e.g., product description, target search engine, keywords, etc.).  In this case, the search optimization system (110) may be configured to generate optimization data based on the product data for the user(s) (106).  Those skilled in the art will
appreciate that the search optimization system (110) may be configured to obtain product data for a user (106) from any number of financial application(s) (108).
<BR><BR> In one or more embodiments of the invention, the search optimization system (110) may be configured to interact with the user(s) (106) using a user interface (114).  More specifically, the user interface (114) may be configured to provide
optimization data to the user (106).  For example, the user (106) may request a search optimization for a web page (104) of the user (106).  In this example, the user interface (114) may process the request to generate optimization data associated with
the web page (104).  The user interface (114) may then present the optimization data to the user (106).  Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the user (106) may request optimization data based on a variety of criteria (e.g., target search
engine(s), preferred web page modification method, etc.).
<BR><BR> FIG. 2 shows a flow chart for performing search engine optimizations in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  In one or more embodiments of the invention, one or more of the steps shown in FIG. 2 may be omitted, repeated,
and/or performed in a different order than that shown in FIG. 2.  Accordingly, the specific arrangement of steps shown in FIG. 2 should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.
<BR><BR> In Step 202, product data for a product may be obtained from a financial application.  In one or more embodiments of the invention, the product data includes a variety of data (e.g., product description, keywords, etc.) associated with the
product.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the product data may further include, but is not limited to, search engine data, consumer account data, or some other data related to the user's product.  In one or more embodiments of the
invention, the financial application is used by the consumer to manage an inventory of products for sale by the user.  For example, the product data is entered into the financial application by the user.  In another example, the product data may be
obtained by the financial application from another data source (e.g., sales system, inventory system, etc.) associated with the user.
<BR><BR> In one or more embodiments of the invention, the product data is included in a request for optimization data from the user of the financial application.  In other cases, the product data is obtained from the financial application on-demand
and/or based on a schedule (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, etc.).
<BR><BR> Optionally, in Step 204, a web page location may be obtained from the financial application.  More specifically, the request for optimization data from the user may further specify the location of a web page for selling the product of the user. 
For example, the request may include a URL to web page of an e-commerce site for selling the product.  Further, the web page location may include information related to Application Program Interfaces (API) and/or Web Services for updating the web page
(i.e., interfaces for the web server providing the web site).
<BR><BR> Optionally, in Step 206, the web page may be processed to obtain a web page search profile.  More specifically, the web page may be processed to identify characteristics of the web page that attribute to the search ranking of the web page.  In
this case, the search ranking of the web page may correspond to the priority of the web page in searches of a particular search engine.  Further, examples of characteristics of the web page may include, but are not limited to, keywords, ingoing links,
and outgoing links.
<BR><BR> In Step 208, the product data may be processed to obtain optimization data.  More specifically, the product data may be analyzed to obtain optimization data for increasing web traffic to the web page.  For example, a product description included
in the product data may be analyzed to identify keywords and recommended keyword replacements.  In this example, the recommended keyword replacements may be configured to improve the search ranking of the web page.  In addition, the frequency of keywords
may also be analyzed to identify optimal keywords for replacing.  In this case, for example, the overuse of a keyword may negatively affect the search ranking of a web page.
<BR><BR> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the search ranking of a web page may be improved based on a variety of characteristics.  Further, each search engine may rely on distinct criteria for determining the search ranking of a web page. 
In this case, the criteria of each of the search engines may be considered when generating the optimization data.
<BR><BR> In one or more embodiments of the invention, the optimization data includes recommendations for updating the web page.  In this case, the recommendations are configured to be used by a user to update the web page via a web server serving the web
page.  In other cases, the optimization data may be configured to be used by a search optimization system as discussed above with respect to FIG. 1 to automatically modify the contents of the web page.
<BR><BR> In one or more embodiments of the invention, the optimization data also includes a predicted search ranking for the web page.  The predicted search ranking may be generated based on recommendations included in the optimization data. 
Specifically, the predicted search ranking predicts the search ranking of the web page if the recommendations in the optimization data are implemented.
<BR><BR> Optionally, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the generation of the optimization data is also based on the web page search profile for the web page.  In this case, for example, the outgoing links specified in the web page search
profile may be analyzed to obtain recommended outgoing links.  Examples of recommended outgoing links may include, but are not limited to, recommendations to update current outgoing links, addition of new outgoing links, and removal of detrimental
outgoing links.  Outgoing links to related web sites typically increase the search ranking of a web page.  However, an outgoing link to a related web site of a lower quality (e.g., link farms, automated linking systems) may have a negative affect on the
search ranking of the web page.
<BR><BR> In Step 210, the web page is updated based on the optimization data.  For example, the user may update the web page based on the recommendations included in the optimization data.  In this example, the user may use a web server of the web page
to implement the recommendations.  In another example, the optimization data may be automatically incorporated into the web page.  In this example, an API and/or Web <B><I>Service</I></B> may be used to dynamically modify the contents of the web page based on the
optimization data.
<BR><BR> In Step 212, the optimization data is transmitted to the financial application.  At this stage, the optimization data may be used to update the product data in the financial application.  For example, if the optimization data includes an updated
product description, the updated product description may be stored for the product.
<BR><BR> FIG. 3 shows a flow chart for performing search engine optimization in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  In one or more embodiments of the invention, one or more of the steps shown in FIG. 3 may be omitted, repeated,
and/or performed in a different order than that shown in FIG. 3.  Accordingly, the specific arrangement of steps shown in FIG. 3 should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.
<BR><BR> In Step 302, a search optimization of product data is requested.  More specifically, a request for search optimization of product data is transmitted to a search optimization system as described above with respect to FIG. 1.  The request may
include a variety of data including, but not limited to, product data, search engine data, and a web page location.  Optionally, the request may also specify target search engine(s) for the search optimization.
<BR><BR> Optionally, the request for search optimization may further specify that the search ranking of a web page should be monitored.  In this case, the search ranking of the web page may also be received when the search ranking is updated.  For
example, after the web page is updated and re-indexed by a search engine, the search ranking of the web page is also updated, triggering a notification of the updated search ranking.  In addition, the search ranking of the web page may also be monitored
to generate a search optimization history for the web page.  The search optimization history may track the search rankings of the web page for search engine(s) over a period of time.  Further, the search optimization history may specify product data for
the product associated with the web page.
<BR><BR> At this stage, optimization data is received in response to the request for search optimization (Step 304).  In Step 306, the optimization data is incorporated.  More specifically, a financial application as described above with respect to FIG.
1 incorporates updated product data included in the optimization data.  For example, the optimization data may include an updated product description and/or updated keywords for a product managed by the financial application.  In this example, the
updated product data may be reviewed and approved by a user of the financial application before it is incorporated into the financial application.
<BR><BR> In Step 308, a web page is updated based on the optimization data.  For example, a user of the financial application may update the web page via a web server based on recommendations included the optimization data.  In another example, the
financial application may automatically update the web page based on the optimization data via an API and/or Web <B><I>Service</I></B>.  In this example, the updates to the web page may be reviewed and approved by the user before the updates are committed to the web
page.
<BR><BR> FIG. 4 shows a flow chart for performing search engine optimizations in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  In one or more embodiments of the invention, one or more of the steps shown in FIG. 4 may be omitted, repeated,
and/or performed in a different order than that shown in FIG. 4.  Accordingly, the specific arrangement of steps shown in FIG. 4 should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.
<BR><BR> In Step 402, a search optimization is performed for product A of web page A using a search optimization history in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  In one or more embodiments of the invention, the search optimization
for product A is as described with respect to FIG. 2 above.  In this case, the search optimization history may be associated with a category of product including the product A. For example, if product A is 5 megapixel digital camera, the category of
product may be "camera" or "digital camera." In this example, the search optimization history includes optimization data and results for search optimizations performed for previous products in the category.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate that
each of the previous products may be associated with a different web page.
<BR><BR> The search optimization history may be configured to allow search optimizations to be performed based on historical search optimizations for the category of product including the product A. In other words, the search optimization history
provides objective results (i.e., search ranking) of previous search optimizations along with the optimization data for each of the previous search optimizations, allowing for search optimizations that leverage the objective results to be generated.  For
example, recommendations used in a previous search optimization resulting in a significant increase in search ranking may be favored over recommendations used in a less successful search optimization.
<BR><BR> In Step 404, the search optimization history is updated based on the search optimization for product A in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  Specifically, after the optimization data is implemented for web page A and the
corresponding search ranking is updated, the optimization data and resulting search ranking of web page A may be included in the search optimization history.  In addition, the search ranking of web page A may be monitored to include further updates of
the search ranking for web page A.
<BR><BR> In Step 406, a search optimization is performed for product B of web page B using the search optimization history in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  In one or more embodiments of the invention, the search optimization
for product B is performed as described with respect to Step 402.  In this case, the search optimization for product B is further based on the optimization data and resulting search ranking for product A.
<BR><BR> In Step 408, the search optimization history is further updated based on the search optimization for product B in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  Specifically, after the optimization data is implemented for web page B
and the search ranking is updated, the optimization data and resulting search ranking of web page B may be included in the search optimization history.  In addition, the search ranking of web page B may be monitored to include further updates of the
search ranking of web page B.
<BR><BR> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a search optimization as described in Steps 402-404 may be repeated for any number of products in the category of product associated with the search optimization history.  In this case, each
subsequent search optimization of a product may be based on the history of search optimizations performed for all of the preceding products.  In other words, the search optimization history may include data associated with any number of search
optimizations performed for products in the category of product associated with the search optimization history.
<BR><BR> FIG. 5 shows a flow chart for performing search engine optimizations in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  In one or more embodiments of the invention, one or more of the steps shown in FIG. 5 may be omitted, repeated,
and/or performed in a different order than that shown in FIG. 5.  Accordingly, the specific arrangement of steps shown in FIG. 5 should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.  Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the following
example is provided for exemplary purposes only and accordingly should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.
<BR><BR> In Step 502, financial application A (108A) sends a request for a search optimization including first product data for a first product to the search optimization system (110) in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  The
request for search optimization may be sent based on input from user A (not shown) of the financial application A (108A).  The user A may specify a variety of criteria and/or data (e.g., target search engine, web page location, product data, etc.) for
the requested search optimization.
<BR><BR> In Step 504, the search optimization system (110) may obtain a first web page search profile from web page A (104A) in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  In this case, the web page A (104A) is included in an e-commerce
site configured to sell the first product for the user A. The first web page search profile describes characteristics (e.g., keywords, content, ingoing links, outgoing links, search ranking, etc.) of the web page A (104A).
<BR><BR> In Step 506, the search optimization system (110) generates first optimization data based on the first product data and the first web page search profile in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  The first optimization data
may include recommendations for updating the web page A (104A) configured to increase the web traffic of the web page A (104A).
<BR><BR> In Step 508, the search optimization system (110) sends the first optimization data to the financial application A (108A) in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  At this stage, the financial application A (108A)
incorporates the first optimization data (Step 510).  More specifically, the product data in financial application A (108A) is updated based on the updated product data included in the first optimization data.
<BR><BR> In Step 512, the financial application A (108A) submits the recommendations included in the first optimization data to the web page A (104A) in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  More specifically, the financial
application A (108A) uses an API and/or Web <B><I>Service</I></B> to submit the recommendations to a web server A (not shown) serving the web page A (104A).  In response to receiving the recommendations, the web server A updates the web page A (104A) based on the
recommendations (Step 514).
<BR><BR> In Step 516, once the web page A (104A) is re-indexed by a search engine (not shown), the search optimization system (110) obtains a first search ranking for web page A (104A) in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  The
first search ranking corresponds to the priority of web page A (104A) in searches of the search engine.
<BR><BR> In Step 518, the search optimization engine (110) updates a search optimization history for the category of product associated with the first product sold on the web page A (104A) in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. 
More specifically, the first optimization data generated in Step 506 and the first search ranking obtain in Step 516 are included in the search optimization history.
<BR><BR> In Step 520, financial application B (108B) sends a request for a search optimization including second product data for a second product to the search optimization system (110) in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  The
request for search optimization may be sent based on input from user B (not shown) of the financial application B (108B).  The user B may specify a variety of criteria and/or data (e.g., target search engine, web page location, product data, etc.) for
the requested search optimization.
<BR><BR> In Step 522, the search optimization system (110) obtains a second web page search profile from web page B (104B) in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  In this case, the web page B (104B) is included in an e-commerce site
configured to sell the second product for the user B. The second web page search profile describes characteristics (e.g., keywords, content, ingoing links, outgoing links, etc.) of the web page B (104B).
<BR><BR> In Step 524, the search optimization system (110) generates second optimization data based on the second product data and the second web page search profile in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  In this case, the second
optimization data is also generated based on the search optimization history updated in Step 518.  More specifically, the recommendations included in the second optimization data may also be generated based on the first optimization data and the
resulting search ranking for web page A (104A).  For example, assuming the update of web page A (104A) resulted in an increase of search ranking for web page A (104A), the recommendations included in the first optimization data may be favored in
generating the second optimization data for web page B (104B).  The optimization data includes recommendations for updating the web page B (104B) to increase the web traffic of the web page B (104B).
<BR><BR> In Step 526, the search optimization system (110) sends the second optimization data to the financial application B (108B) in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  At this stage, the financial application B (108B)
incorporates the second optimization data (Step 528).  More specifically, the product data in financial application B (108B) is updated based on the updated product data included in the second optimization data.
<BR><BR> In Step 530, the financial application B (108B) submits the recommendations included in the second optimization data to the web page B (104B) in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.  More specifically, the user B of the
financial application B (108B) may use a web server B (not shown) to submit the recommendations, where the web server B serves the web page B (104B).  In response to receiving the recommendations, the web server B updates the web page A (104A) based on
the recommendations (Step 532).
<BR><BR> The invention may be implemented on virtually any type of computer regardless of the platform being used.  For example, as shown in FIG. 6, a networked computer system (600) includes a processor (602), associated memory (604), a storage device
